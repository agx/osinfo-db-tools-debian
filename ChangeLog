	osinfo-db-util: Update paths to be compliant with specification
	Per the osinfo db layout spec we have

	 1. system location

	    env $OSINFO_SYSTEM_DIR, defaulting to /usr/share/osinfo

	 2. local location

	    env $OSINFO_LOCAL_DIR, defaulting to /etc/osinfo

	 3. user location

	    env $OSINFO_USER_DIR, defaulting to $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/osinfo
	    or $HOME/.config/osinfo

	osinfo-db-export: generate filename if none is given
	Currently if no filename is given to the export command
	the archive will be written to stdout, which is less than
	helpful as default behaviour. Change it to generate a
	suitable default filename. Export to stdout can still be
	requested explicitly by giving a filename of '-'.

2016-07-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	osinfo-db-export: embed a file called "VERSION"
	Although the version can be inferred from the archive
	filename, once extracted this info is not available.
	Populate the archive with a file called VERSION which
	will be extracted into the root of the DB directory.

	osinfo-db-export: remove '-' in automatic version
	Replace automatic version "2016-07-18" with "20160708" since
	"-" is not a valid character in version numbers for RPM and
	dates sort correctly without "-" being needed.

2016-07-08  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	tools: fix typo  s/termsof/terms of/

	Remove defattr from the RPM spec
	The use of defattr is long since obsolete with RPM

	Fix source link in the RPM spec

	Filter list of files included in created tar
	Don't include hidden files or editor backup files in the
	exported tar. Also whitelist to only include files with
	a .xml, .rng or .ids suffix. This facilitates running
	against a local git repo which may have other files such
	as the automake/autoconf .in and .am files.

	Explicitly set timestamps on entries in created tar file
	Always set a timestamp on entries in the created tar file
	to reflect the time at which the tar was created. This
	ensures when people import new versions of the database,
	the files get newer timestamps.

	Fix swapped file/directory permissions in tar file
	Plain files were given mode 0755 while dirs got 0644, the exact
	opposite of what they should have.

	Remove print of filenames when --verbose is not used
	The osinfo-db-validate command has a --verbose arg to request
	printing of filenames as they are validated. Remove the stray
	g_print() that duplicated this

	Set a valid error domain for GError
	GLib will print a warning if 0 is passed for the GQuark
	error domain when setting a GError. Define a valid error
	domain quark and use it.

	Change osinfo-db-validate to default to a standard location
	Instead of requiring a list of paths to be passed in, default
	to validating files from the standard database locations.

	Find RNG schema in default database locations
	With the split out database, the RNG schema will no longer
	be installed by the code, instead it will be distributed
	as part of the database. Thus we should look in the database
	locations to find the schema.

	Add a new osinfo-db-path tool for reporting db locations
	Applications or system administrators accessing the osinfo
	database directly (instead of via the libosinfo API) will
	need a well defined means of getting the standard database
	locations. The osinfo-db-tool is a trivial command that
	can serve this purpose. eg

	$ osinfo-db-path --system
	/usr/local/share/libosinfo/db

	$ osinfo-db-path --user
	/home/berrange/.config/libosinfo/db

2016-06-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix description of import/export commands
	The command line option help was reporting the wrong description
	for the import/export commands due to cut+paste mistake.

	Share code for getting database path locations
	Both the osinfo-db-import and osinfo-db-export tools have
	the same code for getting the database path locations. Pull
	it out into a osinfo-db-util.c file for sharing.

2016-06-15  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add osinfo-db-export tool for packing an osinfo database archive
	Add a new osinfo-db-export tool which creates an archive in the
	tar (pax) format, with XZ compression and can filling it with the
	database files from one of the standard libosinfo database locations,
	or a custom directory.

	This makes it easy for users to create their own local custom database
	content and then distribute and import it on many machines. It will
	also be used for creating official release archives of the libosinfo
	database from upstream.

	 $ osinfo-db-export --verbose  osinfo-db-2016-06-15.tar.xz
	 osinfo-db-export: d osinfo-db-2016-06-15/
	 osinfo-db-export: d osinfo-db-2016-06-15/datamaps
	 osinfo-db-export: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/datamaps/windows-lang.xml
	 osinfo-db-export: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/datamaps/x11-keyboard.xml

	 osinfo-db-export: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/qemu-usb.xml
	 osinfo-db-export: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/virtio-pci.xml
	 osinfo-db-export: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/xen.xml
	 osinfo-db-export: d osinfo-db-2016-06-15/hypervisors
	 osinfo-db-export: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/hypervisors/kvm.xml
	 ...snip...

	Add osinfo-db-import tool for unpacking an osinfo database archive
	Add a new osinfo-db-import tool which takes an archive in the
	tar (pax) format, with XZ compression and can extract its contents
	into one of the standard libosinfo database locations.

	This makes it easy for users to download new copies of the
	database and unpack them in the right place.

	eg

	 $ osinfo-db-import -v osinfo-db-2016-06-15.tar.xz
	 osinfo-db-import: d osinfo-db-2016-06-15/
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/pci.ids
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/usb.ids
	 osinfo-db-import: d osinfo-db-2016-06-15/datamaps/
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/datamaps/windows-lang.xml
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/datamaps/x11-keyboard.xml
	 osinfo-db-import: d osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/qemu-pci.xml
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/qemu-ps2.xml
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/qemu-usb.xml
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/virtio-pci.xml
	 osinfo-db-import: r osinfo-db-2016-06-15/devices/xen.xml
	 ...snip...

2016-05-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Import trimmed translations from libosinfo project
	This set of trimmed translations was created using the
	following commands

	   $ cp ../../libosinfo/*.po .
	   $ make osinfo-db-tools.pot
	   $ make update-po

	This creates new .po files that only contain message
	strings for the content needed by the new repo.

	Fix build system after creating initial repository
	The initial repository state was created from libosinfo
	GIT at revision:

	  commit 501541a336cd29d3da48584f022ce329fef418dd
	  Author: Fabiano Fidêncio <fidencio@redhat.com>
	  Date:   Thu May 12 18:54:58 2016 +0200

	    win,installer: Fix "Windwos" typo

	It was initialized using the following commands:

	 $ git clone libosinfo osinfo-db-tools
	 $ cd osinfo-db-tools
	 $ git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached \
	      --ignore-unmatch src examples data db test \
	      docs/reference tools/osinfo-detect.c \
	      tools/osinfo-install-script.c \
	      tools/osinfo-query.c po osinfo' HEAD
	 $ git filter-branch -f --prune-empty HEAD
	 $ git for-each-ref --format="%(refname)" refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d
	 $ git reflog expire --expire=now --all
	 $ git gc --prune=now

	This patch now edits the various build system files to
	remove references to bits of the tree that were deleted,
	and rename from libosinfo to osinfo-db-tools.

	Currently this module contains a single command

	  osinfo-db-validate

	It will later be augmented with tools for importing
	and exporting database archives.

	In commit 97091136bd037aa44da13873ac910320b9ad7e6b we changed

	Remove checks/code for GLib older than 2.35.1
	As now we depend on GLib 2.36, let's remove all checks/code that depend
	on an older version than the one we require.

	Use GTask instead of GSimpleAsyncResult
	Instead of using GSimpleAsyncResult, use the new GTask API, which is
	much more straightforward.
	For using the new GTask API, let's bump GIO (part of GLib) dependency
	version to 2.36.
	what is safe based on major distro support:
	- Debian Jessie: glib-2.42
	- RHEL-7.1: glib-2.40

	configure: bump libsoup version to 2.42
	By bumping libsoup version, we are fixing a few deprecated warnings in
	our tests (use SoupSession directly rather than SoupSessionAsync) and as
	a side effect we don't need libsoup-gnome anymore.

	Based on a patch from Fabiano Fidêncio <fidencio@redhat.com>

2015-10-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	loader: implement new semantics for entity overriding
	This implements the new scheme for allowing entities to
	be overridden. If an XML file relative path matches one
	in an earlier datbase directory, the original file is
	not loaded at all. Any files in a ENTITY-NAME.d will
	now augment earlier data rather than replace it.

	eg consider these files

	1. /usr/share/libosinfo/db/os/fedoraproject.org/fedora-22.xml
	2. /etc/libosinfo/db/os/fedoraproject.org/fedora-22.xml
	3. $HOME/.config/libosinfo/db/os/fedoraproject.org/fedora-22.d/extra.xml

	File #1 will not get loaded, because file #2 is detected
	as a full override. File #2 will get loaded to define the
	main Fedora 22 OS, and then file #3 will get loaded to
	augment the main data.

	Most of the PCI and USB device info in the local DB is
	just augmenting the pci.ids and usb.ids master files,
	so these need to move to .d directories now

	loader: rework handling of pci.ids and usb.ids
	Currently we have the option to download pci.ids/usb.ids or
	symlink to the distro provided version given to configure.

	Change configure so that it searches for the files in a
	variety of expected locations. This ensures we always use
	the external files, in any modern Linux distro, without
	the user needing to give an arg. We look for them in

	   /usr/share/hwdata/{pci.ids,usb.ids} (RHEL/Fedora)
	   /usr/share/misc/{pci.ids,usb.ids}   (Ubuntu/Debian/Gentoo)
	   /usr/share/{pci.ids,usb.ids}        (SLES/OpenSuse)

	Instead of loading the pci.ids/usb.ids files as part of
	the main database file enumeration process, explicitly
	load them from their expected location. This avoids the
	need to symlink the distro provided files into the database
	dir.

	Update ignore files for new database layout

	data: remove pluralization from data directories
	eg instead of platforms/qemu.org/qemu-1.2.0.xml we just have
	platform/qemu.org/qemu-1.2.0. The top level directory name
	now matches the entity name exactly

	data: split devices into one file per device

	The database directory name matches the object name, except in
	the case of the platform object, where the directory is named
	"hypevisors". Change the dir name to "platforms" to be consistent.

	Add a document that sets out the desired end goal for the

	Ditch udev rule
	New udev/blkid expose more ISO9660 properties that apps can grab and
	set on install media for detection to work. As a result our udev rule
	becomes redundant.

	This improves system bootup time conciderably if there is an ISO9660
	media inserted during bootup as our udev rule needed to parse the XML
	etc and is therefore pretty slow (keeping in mind that a few seconds are
	a long time in the land of modern udev/systemd).

	Disable static libraries by default
	Every source file is currently built twice by libtool, once for
	the shared library and once for the static library. Static libs
	are not commonly packaged by distros and slow down compilation
	time by almost 100% compared to a shared-only build time.

	Time for non-parallel make

	      shared only: 22 secs
	  shared + static: 40 secs

	Those few people who really want them, can pass --enable-static
	to configure

	Disabling them by default requires use of LT_INIT. We don't need
	to support older libtool, so drop use of AM_PROG_LIBTOOL entirely.
	Also add the 'win32-dll' flag, since that should have been there
	already

	Allow to use system pci.ids/usb.ids files
	Most distros already ship copies of pci.ids/usb.ids. This commit
	allows to make use of these rather than the ones shipped with

	pod2man used to be in the default Fedora build root, but that's
	changed in current rawhide.

	The containing package is perl-podlators, but since that package
	doesn't exist on F18 and earlier, it's easiest just to depend on
	the needed binary.

2013-03-04  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Release 0.2.5

2013-02-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add Marc-André to AUTHORS
	Fixes `make syntax-check`

2013-01-02  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	configure: Use LINGUAS file
	Setting ALL_LINGUAS in configure.in is obsolete according to po.m4 in
	favor of LINGUAS file. This is the reason why all (as far as I can see)
	GNOME modules use LINGUAS file.

	Also the rule in configure.ac creates broken Makefile if there is more
	than one translation files:

	[zeenix@z-laptop libosinfo]$ make
	Makefile:166: *** missing separator.  Stop.
	[zeenix@z-laptop libosinfo]$ head -n 166 Makefile|tail -n 2
	ALL_LINGUAS = pl
	uk

2012-12-13  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	win: Add language information to Windows medias
	Now that libosinfo knows how to use the l10n-language OsinfoDB attribute,
	we can add this data to the various Windows <media> definitions in
	the database.

	build-sys: Build data/ before test/
	Some test cases use the in-tree database data. Since some database files
	are transformed from .xml.in to .xml during build, it's better to
	build data/ first to ensure they are there when tests try to use
	this data.

2012-11-10  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Use glib-mkenums to register enums with glib
	This commit adds the generation of osinfo_enum_types.[ch] using
	glib-mkenums. These files will register the various enums that will get
	added to osinfo header files with glib.

	Commit message shamelessly stolen from a similar commit to libvirt-glib
	by Christophe Fergeau <cfergeau@redhat.com>.

2012-11-06  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	maint: update to latest gnulib maint.mk
	* maint.mk: Resynchronize from gnulib.
	* cfg.mk (_gl_translatable_string_re): Reflect new gnulib naming.

2012-10-31  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Steal libvirt magic for picking translation files
	Since we don't keep a static LINGUAS file, we need to do this for
	intltool to pick-up our translation (.po) files.

	Translate all (potentially) user visible strings
	Make some strings more translator-friendly at the same time.

2012-10-30  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	autogen: Remove redundant intltoolize call
	gnome-autogen.sh calls this for us.

	Thanks to Christophe Fergeau <cfergeau@redhat.com> for pointing this out.

	Update .gitignore

2012-10-29  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Mark obvious strings in DB for translation
	Mark 'name' and 'vendor' in oses and hypervisor, and 'name' in devices
	for translation.

	This implies that now we generate the actual XML files to automatically
	get translations inserted into them.

	Co-author: Eric Blake <eblake@redhat.com>

2012-10-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	maint.mk: Resync from gnulib.
	AUTHORS: Add myself.

2012-10-26  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Add translation framework
	Note that we are calling bindtextdomain() from Loader's class init.
	AFAICT, its a common practice in libraries without any main _init()
	function to make this call in init of the most common/useful class (e.g
	gdk-pixbuf and gdbus).

	Update .gitignore

2012-10-19  Michal Privoznik  <mprivozn@redhat.com>

	AUTHORS: Add David to the authors file
	as he contributed by fixing udev rule.

2012-10-10  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	docs: Remove redundant .types file
	Since we pass --rebuild-types to gtkdoc scanner, .types file is
	generated for us and therefore we don't want to keep this in VCS.

2012-08-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update git ignore rules

	Add data files for Fedora & Windows unattended installs
	For Fedora this adds a kickstart file template which self-adapts
	to all Fedora versions 1-> 16

	For Windows this adds two file templates, one using the legacy
	SIF .ini file format for Win2k3 or earlier, and the other using
	the modern unattended XML format for Win2k8 or newer

	Add a command line tool for generating install scripts

	Add APIs for dealing with installer automation scripts
	This introduces two new objects

	 - OsinfoInstallConfig - stores configuration parameters which get
	   substituted into the install script template.
	 - OsinfoInstallScript - provides a template and the mechanism for
	   turning it into an install script using XSLT

2012-06-08  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	build: allow building with newer glibc-headers and -O0
	Commit log and autoconf snippet written by Eric Blake for libvirt.

	glibc 2.15 (on Fedora 17) coupled with explicit disabling of
	optimization during development dies a painful death:

	In file included from /usr/include/limits.h:27:0,
	                 from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.7.0/include/limits.h:169,.
	                 from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.7.0/include/syslimits.h:7,
	                 from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.7.0/include/limits.h:34,
	                 from util/bitmap.c:26:
	/usr/include/features.h:314:4: error: #warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O) [-Werror=cpp]
	cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

	Work around this by only conditionally defining _FORTIFY_SOURCE,
	in the case where glibc can actually use it.  The trick is using
	AH_VERBATIM instead of AC_DEFINE.

	* m4/libosinfo-compile-warnings.m4 (LIBOSINFO_COMPILE_WARNINGS): Squelch
	_FORTIFY_SOURCE when needed to avoid glibc #warnings.

2012-05-15  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Add missing % to %{rhel} macro
	This fixes the previous commit.

	Fix spec file for RHEL builds
	%fedora is not defined when building for RHEL, so we need to use
	%{?fedora} instead of %{fedora}. This commit also makes sure that
	newer RHELs will build libosinfo with introspection support.

2012-03-27  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	configure.ac: don't error out when vala autodetection fails
	When --enable-vala or --disable-vala are not passed to configure,
	configure.ac automatically checks for vala availability. However,
	in this case, it's erroring out when vapigen cannot be found instead
	of silently disabling it.

	configure.ac: set VAPIGEN when --enable-vala is passed
	It was only set when the vala detection was automatic (ie no
	--enable-vala on the command line)

2012-03-23  Fabiano Fidêncio  <fabiano@fidencio.org>

	Remove obsolete scripts for PCI/USB id conversion
	The osinfo-pciids-convert and osinfo-usbids-convert scripts
	are no longer required, since we can load the data files
	natively. Remove them to avoid a runtime dep on Perl.

2012-03-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add a 'osinfo-query' command line tool
	Enable end users to search the database with a new osinfo-query

	Better udev rule installation
	Provide a configure option to set the udev rule directory. If this
	option is not set, udev directory defaults to '$prefix/lib/udev/rules.d'
	unless $prefix is '/usr' in which case it defaults to '/lib/udev/rules.d'.

	if media is bootable.

2011-09-01  Zeeshan Ali (Khattak)  <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

	Add utility app that detects OS given a media
	Given a path to a ISO9660 image/device, detects if media is bootable and
	the relavent OS if media is an installer for it.

2011-06-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add some more realistic data files
	Start on basic metadata for Fedora/RHEL and QEMU/Xen

2011-04-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add some scripts for converting USB/PCI ID lists to XML
	Add some scripts which are able to convert from the raw USB
	and PCI device ID lists to the osinfo XML format. Do not
	actually use these scripts by default though, because the
	osinfo loader can read the native formats *much* faster
	than reading the XML variant

	Pull down USB and PCI device IDs from sourceforge
	Populate the database with all USB and PCI device IDs known
	to the master sourceforge databases

2010-09-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add notes about possible data sources for populating the database
	Add notes about the possible sources for finding device info
	about operating systems and hypervisor platforms

	* docs/data-sources.txt: Note data sources for OS and hypervisors

	Introduce a OsinfoDeployment object
	The supported devices for deploying an OS on a platform are
	tracked as part of the main OS device list. This is not
	sufficiently flexible because it does not allow for tracking
	extra metadata against a (os, platform) pair. Introduce a
	new "deployment" object to track the metadata for deploying
	an OS on a platform.

	* docs/object-model.fig: Illustrate the object model
	* data/libosinfo-dummy-data.xml: Introduce deployment
	  metadata
	* examples/demo.py, examples/demo.js: Update for new
	  APIs

	  osinfo/osinfo.h, osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h
	  osinfo/osinfo_db.h, osinfo/osinfo_deployment.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_deploymentlist.c, osinfo/osinfo_deploymentlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_devicelink.c, osinfo/osinfo_loader.c: Introduce
	  an explicit deployment object
	* osinfo/osinfo_os.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.h, test/test-db.c,
	  test/test-os.c: Remove tracking of hypervisor preferred
	  devices
	* osinfo/osinfo_devicelinkfilter.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_devicelinkfilter.h: Allow filtering against
	  a link and its target device at the same time.

	Introduce a new OsinfoProduct abstract class
	It is neccessary to track upgrades/clones/derives relationships
	for platforms as well as operating systems. Introduce a common
	parent class for both called OsinfoProduct

	* data/libosinfo-dummy-data.xml: Make platform XML use the
	  common product XML attributes/relationships
	* docs/reference/Libosinfo-docs.xml, docs/reference/Libosinfo-sections.txt,
	  docs/reference/Libosinfo.types: Update for new/renamed classes
	* osinfo/Makefile.am, osinfo/libosinfo.syms,
	  osinfo/osinfo.h: New OsinfoProduct class
	* osinfo/osinfo_product.c, osinfo/osinfo_product.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_productlist.h, osinfo/osinfo_productlist.c: New
	  classes
	* osinfo/osinfo_os.c, osinfo/osinfo_os.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_platform.c, osinfo/osinfo_platform.h: Change
	  to inherit from OsinfoProduct
	* osinfo/osinfo_oslist.c, osinfo/osinfo_oslist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_platformlist.c, osinfo/osinfo_platformlist.h:
	  Change to inherit from OsinfoProductList
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h, osinfo/osinfo_loader.c:
	  Update for new class hierarchy
	* osinfo/osinfo_osfilter.c, osinfo/osinfo_osfilter.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_osfilter.h, osinfo/osinfo_productfilter.h: Rename
	  filter class

2010-09-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add two examples using GObject introspection
	Add two example programs using GObject introspection bindings
	for Python (PyGObject) and Javascript (GJS)

	* examples/demo.js: Javascript demo
	* examples/demo.py: Python demo
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Add examples Makefile
	* examples/Makefile.am: Include demos in dist
	* libosinfo.spec.in: Include demo programs + docs
	* mingw32-libosinfo.spec.in: Kill docs

	Ensure args can be passed to autogen.sh
	Ensure that autogen.sh honours args passed to it, but passing
	them on down to gnome-autogen.sh, enabling usage such as

	   ./autogen.sh --enable-coverage

	* autogen.sh: Pass command line args down to gnome-autogen.sh

	Add API docs for all public methods
	Add GTK-DOC api docs for all public methods, signals, objects,
	enums, etc. Include annotations required for GObject Introspection
	to get reference counting / memory allocation correct when doing
	automatic language binding generation

	* osinfo/*.c: Add API docs for all methods / signals / objects / enums
	* osinfo/*.h: Ensure parameter names match those in the corresponding
	  .c file implementation to avoid confusing gtk-doc

	Integrate gtk-doc into the build for API docs
	* Makefile.am: Add docs subdir
	* autogen.sh: Enable gtk-doc build by default
	* configure.ac: Add check for gtk-doc
	* doc/api.txt, doc/overview.txt: Remove inaccurate, outdated
	  docs
	* docs/Makefile.am: Add reference/ subdir
	* docs/reference/: bare template for gtk-doc content

2010-08-27  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	* libosinfo.spec.in: Enable tests
	* libosinfo.spec.in: Disable tests
	* test/test-loader.c, test/Makefile.am: Fix VPATH build

	Ignore more test programs

	Convert loader to use GIO
	Direct use of POSIX/stdc I/O is deprecated in favour of
	the GIO system. Re-write the OsinfoLoader to use GIO
	for loading XML from arbitrary paths/uris.

	* configure.ac: Check for GIO library
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Link to GIO
	* osinfo/osinfo_loader.c, osinfo/osinfo_loader.h: Port
	  to GIO
	* test/osinfo.suppression: Supress many GIO data types
	* test/test-loader.c: update for new GIO api.

	Lots of code fixes based on results from testsuite
	This fixes numerous memory leaks throughout the code
	identified by valgrind. It also fixes the const-ness
	of many parameters

	* osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c: Rewrite from scratch using DOM
	  APIs instead of streaming APIs
	* osinfo/osinfo_db.h, osinfo/osinfo_db.c: Remove 'libvirtVer' property
	  and declare all gchar * parameters to be const. Fix some mem leaks

	* osinfo/osinfo_osfilter.c: Fix some mem leaks

	Comprehensive test suite
	This adds a comprehensive test suite. Each test case
	fulls covers a single class. Combined, they provide
	100% function and 99% line coverage. All important
	code branches are also covered.

	* Makefile.am: Target to generate code coverage reports
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Add code coverage flags
	* configure.ac: Enable use of 'check' for test suite
	  and use of gcc coverage flags
	* test/test-*.c: One test suite per class
	* test/test-skeleton.c: Remove obsoleted test
	* test/osinfo.suppression: supress valgrind warning for
	  static data in glib type system
	* test/Makefile.am: Link tests against libcheck library

2010-08-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add missing AC_ARG_ENABLE declaration
	The configure.ac script was missing the AC_ARG_ENABLE declaration
	for the gobject introspection code

	* configure.ac: Add AC_ARG_ENABLE

2010-08-25  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add LGPLv2+ header to all source files
	* osinfo/*.h, osinfo/*.c: Add license header text
	* COPYING.LIB: LGPLv2+ license
	* libosinfo.spec.in, mingw32-libosinfo.spec.in,
	  Makefile.am: Use COPYING.LIB instead of COPYING

	Add formal RPM build infrastructure
	* autogen.sh: Rewrite to use gnome-autogen.sh
	* autobuild.sh: Automated RPM build control script
	* configure.ac: Generate RPM specfiles
	* Makefile.am: Distribute RPM specfile templates
	* libosinfo.spec.in, mingw32-libosinfo.spec.in: RPM specs
	* osinfo/Makefile.am, osinfo/libosinfo.syms: Fix Win32
	  portability problem

	Add support for GObject introspection
	Introspect the libosinfo API so that non-C language bindings
	can be automagically generated

	* osinfo/osinfo.h, osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_device.h, osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_entity.h, osinfo/osinfo_filter.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.h, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_os.h, osinfo/osinfo_oslist.h: Add explicit
	  includes to match build dependancies, to satisfy g-ir-scanner
	  limitations. Rename enum values to allow them to be extracted
	  with correct names

	Add a pkg-config data file for building apps
	* configure.ac: Generate libosinfo.pc
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Install pkg-config file
	* osinfo/libosinfo-1.0.pc.in: Master pkg-config template

	Use pkg-config for checking for libxml
	Rather than creating huge amounts of m4 logic, just use pkg-config
	to check for libxml2 library. Make libxml2 compulsory

	* configure.ac: Simplify libxml2 check

	Add proper ELF versioning
	Rename library to libosinfo-1.0.la to allow parallel install if
	we need to break ABI in the future. Add per-symbol version tagging
	to allow fine grained automatic RPM dependancies. Make version
	script portable to Win32

	* configure.ac: Detect args for linker symbol file / format
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Rename library and use symbol versioning
	* osinfo/libosinfo.syms: Symbol version script

	Run configure at end of autogen.sh
	It is usual practice to run configure at the end of
	autogen.sh to save having to manually run it afterwards

	* autogen.sh: Run configure

	Remove osinfo common module
	Finally all objects are fully private and the common
	code module can be banished.

	* osinfo/osinfo_common.c, osinfo/osinfo_common.h: Delete
	* osinfo/Makefile.am, osinfo/osinfo.h: Remove osinfo_common.h
	* configure.ac: Use osinfo/osinfo_db.c in CONFIG_SRCDIR
	* osinfo/osinfo_dataread.c, osinfo/osinfo_db.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_db.h, osinfo/osinfo_device.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_devicelist.h, osinfo/osinfo_entity.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_entity.h, osinfo/osinfo_filter.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_hypervisor.h, osinfo/osinfo_hypervisorlist.h,
	  osinfo/osinfo_list.h, osinfo/osinfo_os.c,
	  osinfo/osinfo_os.h, osinfo/osinfo_oslist.h: Add the
	  main object typedefs, previously in the common module.
	  Rename osinfoRelationship to OsinfoOsRelationship.

	Add decl for all _get_type() methods & enable warnings
	Eliminate compile warnings about undeclared XXX_get_type()
	methods, by adding declarations for all objects.

	Switch to using standard GNOME m4 magic for compile
	warnings. Force enablement of automake maintainer
	mode, so that Makefile is re-generated if Makefile.am
	ever changes. Enable silent build rules so that compile
	warnings can be more easily spotted.

	* Makefile.am: Whitespace tweak
	* configure.ac: Remove -Wall, -Werror. Add
	  GNOME_COMPILE_WARNINGS, GNOME_MAINTAINER_MODE_DEFINES,
	  AM_MAINTAINER_MODE, AM_SILENT_RULES
	* osinfo/*.h: Add XXX_get_type() declarations for all
	  objects
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Add $(WARN_CFLAGS) to build

	Move Makefile.am into each sub-dir
	Move Makefile.am into each sub-dir so that built objects end
	up in the same directory as the sources, instead of polluting
	the top level. This will also enable the gobject introspection
	makefile rules to be imported later

	* .gitignore: test-skeleton & test-skeleton.sh
	* Makefile.am: Remove all build rules, add SUBDIRS
	* osinfo/Makefile.am: Add build rules for library
	* test/Makefile.am: Add build rules for tests
	* test/test-skeleton.c: Update to reflect changed
	  current directory during test execution

	Move all source & headers into osinfo/ directory
	The GLib/GObject standard practice is to have all source and
	header files in the same directory, named after the library
	prefix. Move all headers from api/ and inc/ into src/, then
	rename src/ to osinfo/

	* src/*, api/*, inc/*: Move to osinfo/
	* Makefile.am: Update build rules for changed locations
	* configure.ac: change AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR

2010-07-01  Arjun Roy  <arroy@redhat.com>

	Moved over API to use glib/gobject. API definitions have changed, though functionality remains identical. Added new features to list classes.
	TODO: Extensive testing. Codebase compiles and simplest test of
	creating/destroying DB works, but more is required.

2010-02-03  Arjun Roy  <arroy@redhat.com>

	Added autogen.sh

2010-02-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	autoconfiscate
	* Makefile.am: New file.
	* configure.ac: New file.
