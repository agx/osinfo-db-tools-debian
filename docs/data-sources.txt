 Data Sources for libosinfo metadata
 ===================================

libosinfo is only as good as the data it is given.
Identifying data sources is thus a key component.

Website databases
-----------------

A list of all known PCI vendor + product IDs is available
from

  http://pciids.sourceforge.net/v2.2/pci.ids

A list of all known USB vendor + product IDs is available
from

  http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids

These can be used to populate the master list of devices.
This leaves non-USB/PCI devices to be populated manually
eg legacy ISA, PS/2, serial etc.

Linux kernels
-------------

 - modinfo against a kmod shows aliases

   # modinfo e1000.ko  | grep alias
      alias:          pci:v00008086d000010B5sv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d00001099sv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d0000108Asv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d0000107Csv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d0000107Bsv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d0000107Asv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d00001079sv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d00001078sv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      alias:          pci:v00008086d00001077sv*sd*bc*sc*i*
      ...

   These lines can be parsed to identify the PCI/USB/etc product +
   vendor IDs, and thus populate device link objects.

Linux distros
-------------

Identify the kernel used by the installer for each architecture,
and extract device links from there

KVM/QEMU hypervisor
-------------------

0.12 or later has a '-device ?' to print all known devices, but
this lacks vendor/product IDs. Get this fixed upstream, or manually
match them up to devices

Prior to 0.12 requires fully manual effort to identify supported
devices

Xen hypervisor
--------------

A tiny set of paravirt devices + whatever the QEMU-DM build will
support. Make sure that -device ? doesn't get broken for the latter

VMware
